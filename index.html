				<h3>Self-catering Accomodation</h3>
				<p>High Shield Cottage is a spacious single storey building that provides self-catered accommodation for
					two people. The cottage offers visitors exceptional views and easy access to many remarkable
					attractions.</p>
				<p>Local written records provide evidence that there was a working farm on the site in the late 1700s.
					While archaeological evidence of a medieval stacking stand and aerial photography hinting at the
					remains of two earlier dwellings suggest earlier activity on the site. However, the site was
					abandoned in the 1930s with buildings irregularly used as a byre. In 1994 the property was restored
					to the condition that it is in today.</p>
				<p>The cottage is located half way along Hadrian’s Wall, lying half a mile south of where the wall
					crosses the Pennines near Rapishaw Gap. This stretch of the Wall follows the natural line of the
					Whin Sill, a dramatic escarpment of ancient igneous rock. Many of the Wall’s most iconic sites are
					found within easy walking distance of the cottage. From the cottage you can walk north to Hadrian’s
					Wall or to the south to Vindolanda, the village of Bardon Mill and onto the river Tyne.</p>
				<p>Getting to Old High Shield Cottage is easy. The cottage lies a few miles north of the A69 main and on
					the Roman military road. Regional train and bus services run to the local village of Bardon Mill and
					from there it is a 45 minute cross-country walk. In the summer, the 122AD Hadrian's Wall Bus runs
					from the local market town of Hexham along the B6318 Military Road to the Once Brewed Visitors
					Centre one mile west of the cottage.</p>

				<h3>Hadrian’s Wall</h3>
				<p>Hadrian’s Wall is almost 1900 years old and stretches 73 miles across the north of England from
					Bowness-on-Solway to Wallsend on the river Tyne. It took three legions just over six years to build.
					Hadrian’s Wall is probably the most important Roman monument to have survived in Britain and has
					been awarded World Heritage Site status.</p>
				<p>Old High Shield is situated half way along the wall, lying just half a mile south of its highest
					point where Hadrian’s Wall crosses the Pennines close to Rapishaw Gap. It is at this point that the
					wall follows the natural line of the Whin Sill, a dramatic escarpment of ancient igneous rock. The
					surrounding countryside is spectacular and many of the wall’s favourite views are to be found in
					this area.</p>
				<p>Various forts, milecastles and turrets can still be seen along the length of the wall, as well as the
					ditch to the north and the great Vallum earthworks to the south (the course of the Vallum crosses
					the entrance road to High Shield). Sycamore Gap, used in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves
					is half a mile west.</p>

				<h3>Housesteads Roman Fort (Vercovicium)</h3>
				<p>Housesteads is only 2 miles from High Shield and is the best preserved of the sixteen outposts along
					Hadrian’s Wall. It has spectacular views of the surrounding countryside, a museum and ruins that
					include the four double-portal gateways and perimeter wall, granaries, barracks, under floor heating
					system and some of the earliest known flushing toilets.</p>
				<p>After visiting Housesteads Roman fort, why not explore more of Hadrian's Wall and experience the
					romance of this famous monument? Now a World Heritage Site, Hadrian's Wall spans 73 miles of
					beautiful British countryside. Walk around the many forts, turrets and mile castles that span the
					Wall, and absorb 2,000 years of history.</p>

				<h3>Vindolanda</h3>
				<p>Vindolanda lies half a mile south of Old High Shield Cottage. The site of Vindolanda predates
					Hadrian's Wall and was occupied from around AD 85. The fort was built to guard the central section
					of the vital east to west supply route, now known as the Stanegate. Following construction of the
					wall, around forty years later, Vindolanda became a wall fort. Visitors to Vindolanda can view a
					range of excavated remains including a bath house, barracks, officer’s residence and a temple. The
					Vindolanda Tablets are among the most significant Roman artifacts to have been found anywhere in the
					former Roman Empire</p>
				<p>Vindolanda was occupied by the Roman army from around AD 85 when the first fort was built to guard
					the central section of the vital east to west supply route, now known as the Stanegate. Some 40
					years later when Hadrian’s Wall was built, Vindolanda became a Wall fort. Visitors can view a range
					of excavated remains include a bath house, barracks, officer’s residence and temple. Vindolanda is
					half a mile south of Old High Shield.</p>
				<p>The museum displays a vast range of Roman artefacts including leather goods, textiles, wooden, bronze
					and iron objects, as well as the slivers of wood covered in spidery ink writing. The translation of
					these findings is providing primary evidence of everyday life in this area.</p>

				<h3>Kielder Reservoir</h3>
				<p>Home to northern Europe’s largest man-made lake and England's largest forest, Kielder Water & Forest
					Park is one of Northumberland's best attractions.</p>
				<p>It is perfect for individuals or families that love nature, water sports, exploring, walking, cycling
					and much more.</p>
				<p>Kielder Water & Forest Park features mile upon mile of purpose-built trails including forest walks
					for all the family and dedicated mountain bike tracks. The Lakeside Way is a 26 mile multi-user
					trail, suitable for walkers, cyclists, horse riders and wheelchair users, that encircles the
					shoreline of Kielder Water.</p>
				<p>A haven for wildlife, Kielder Water & Forest Park is also home to around 50% of England’s native red
					squirrel population. In 2009 three chicks were born to a record breaking osprey couple - the first
					birds for at least 200 years to successfully raise chicks in Northumberland. So far they have
					returned to breed every year since. You can also spot otters, roe deer badgers and bats.</p>
				<p>Waterskiing and sailing enthusiasts take to the water all year round and the lake offers a huge
					challenge to keen trout anglers between March and October.</p>

				<h3>Kielder Observatory</h3>
				<p>A star gazers' heaven! The Park is lucky enough to have the darkest night skies in England, thanks to

				<h3>Haltwhistle</h3>
				<p>Haltwhistle is a market town situated 5 miles from Old High Shield next to the South Tyne river. The
					town has a market day on Thursday's. Geographically it claims to be the exact Centre of Britain.</p>
				<p> During its turbulent past the area suffered from feuding and raiding from the Border Reivers and
					many buildings in the area were heavily fortified. Just behind the Market Square is Holy Cross
					Church, a fine example of early 13th century architecture with a Burne-Jones painted chancel roof
					and William Morris windows. </p>
				<p> The town has a leisure centre and heated outdoor swimming pool in the summer months. </p>
