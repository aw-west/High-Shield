  <span class="style8">Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall is almost 1900 years old. It stretches for 73 miles across what is now northern England from Bowness-on-Solway in the west to Wallsend in the east. It took three Roman legions over six years to build with constructing starting in 122AD. It is arguably the most significant Roman monument to have survived in Britain and has been awarded World Heritage Site status (<a href="http://www.visithadrianswall.co.uk/"><strong>Hadrian's Wall Country</strong></a>).</span></p>

It is the most well preserved of the sixteen outposts that line Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall. It is also the most iconic of these outposts, with spectacular views over the surrounding countryside. It is also a good day out with a museum and various ruins including four double-portal gateways, a perimeter wall, granaries, barracks, under floor heating system and some of the earliest known flushing toilets to check out (<a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hadrians-wall/"><strong>The National Trust</strong></a>).</p>

                    <p class="style9">Vindolanda lies half a mile south of Old High Shield Cottage. The site of Vindolanda predates Hadrian's Wall and was occupied from around AD 85. The fort was built to guard the central section of the vital east to west supply route, now known as the Stanegate. Following construction of the wall, around forty years later, Vindolanda became a wall fort. Visitors to Vindolanda can view a range of excavated remains including a bath house, barracks, officer&rsquo;s residence and a temple. The Vindolanda Tablets are among the most significant Roman artifacts to have been found anywhere in the former Roman Empire (<strong><a href="http://www.vindolanda.com/">Vindolanda Charitable Trust</a></strong>) .</p>

The town also has a leisure centre and heated outdoor swimming pool in the summer months (<strong><a href="http://www.haltwhistle.org/">Haltwhistle Partnership</a></strong>).</p>
